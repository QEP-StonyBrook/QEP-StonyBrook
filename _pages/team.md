      <p>
        Hyeongrak Choi received his PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2021 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under Prof. Dirk Englund. He earned his M.S. in the same field in 2017 from MIT, after receiving his B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Seoul National University in 2014. During his graduate studies, he was a recipient of both the <b>Claude E. Shannon Fellowship</b> and the <b>Samsung Scholarship</b>. After PhD, he continued as a postdoctoral associate at MIT until August 2024, when he started as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University. His research focuses on quantum computing, networking, sensing, and photonics.
